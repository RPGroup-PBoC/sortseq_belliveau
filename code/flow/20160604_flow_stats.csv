# Comments about run:
# date: 20160604
# dgoR related:
# Cells were grown in M9 galactonate for sorting the three different plasmid
# libraries (mut1, mut2, and mut3 which correspond to the three mutation windows).
# purT and xylE related:
# Regrowth and measurement of sorted cells. Only the low and high bins
# were measured to confirm that cells were sorted (three mutated windows).
# A) purT promoter grown in M9 glucose.
# B) xylE promoter grown in M9 xylose.
# In addition, cells containing purT promoter were grown in M9 glucose
# with 100 ug/ml adenine supplemented. These were sorted.
