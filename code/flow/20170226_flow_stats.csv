# Comments about run:
# date: 20170226
# note: measurements done with FL1 600V and 1.3H;
# I was paying attention to SSC and initially labelled
# the settings incorrectly.
# Measurements were taken of purR and dgoR simple repression
# constructs, a xylR simple activation construct
#(with IPTG added at 1 mM due to presence of O1 binding site downstream).
# The amount of 'activation' isn't that much.
# and another ~60bp window upstream of dgoR.
# sorting was done of the the purR and dgoR constructs.
