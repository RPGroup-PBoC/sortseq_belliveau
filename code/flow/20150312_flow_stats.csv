# Although I sorted marRAB libraries already, the promoter appeared essentially
# 'off' in M9 glucose. Here I tried growth in LB 30C (and M9 30C), which is
# supposed to cause the promoter to be expressed more. Although it didn't show a
# dramatic increase in expression, it looked more encouraging and I went ahead
# with sorting.
# I also looked at a delta relB and delta relBE strains
#  (wild-type and mutant library). These were sorted.
