# This was a regrowth of the sort with only the marA TF binding site mutated.
# marRAB: LB 30C
# I also tested out a promoter plasmid of relBE where a spacer (1kb; approx) was
# placed between the native rbs and the GFP rbs to reduce coupling. Doesn't
# appear to be much expression and will have to think on this one.
