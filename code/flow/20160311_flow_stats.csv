# Comments about run
# date: 20160311
# mar related:
# Here only the marA region of the mut 2 region of the mar promoter was mutated.
# This was previously sorted into two bins, and here they were re-measured to
# see if there was a difference.
# rel related:
# Our expectation is that 4 bins is sufficient in general for use to be able to
# produce good information footprints as well as infer energy models. To test this
# we considered sorting into different binning schemes than usual.
# 1. regular sorting: 4 15% windows
# 2. 4 bins , 25% windows
# 3. 8 bins, 10-12.5% windows
