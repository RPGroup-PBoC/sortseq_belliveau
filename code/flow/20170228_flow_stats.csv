# Sorting seems to have worked properly now. Not sure why it didn't the day before.
# Looked at regrowth of dgoR mut4 in M9 galactonate and xylR simple activation constructs.
# sorted: dgoR simple repression constructs with or without dgoR
# knocked in a MG1655 delta dgoR strain.
# purRO simple repression constructs were also sorted. This was in M9 glucose with or without
adenine added at 100 ng/ul.
# note: all done with 700V and 1H . all xylR binned
# are these settings. The only ones that are # 600V_1.3H are the deltadgoR and deltadgoRintdgoR that say it.
