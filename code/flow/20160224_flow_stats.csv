# Comments about run
# date: 20160224
# This was a sort with libraries where only the TF binding sites were mutated.
# relBE: M9 glucose; marRAB: LB 30C
# I also tested out a promoter plasmid of relBE where a spacer (1kb; approx) was
# placed between the native rbs and the GFP rbs to reduce coupling. It doesn't
# appear to be working (expression is super low), even in non-mutated version.
