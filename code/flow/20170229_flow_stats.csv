# Comments about run:
# date: 20170229
# Looked at regrowth of dgoR mut4 in M9 glucose, dgoR
# simple repression constructs, and purR simple repression
# constructs (purRO constructs was in M9 glcuose with or without
adenine added at 100 ng/ul.). Note that bin 3 was bimodal with an axtra peak at high fluorescence This bin was re-sorted to seperate the two. Sorting looks good overall.
# note: Several bin histograms appear backwards - they are actually backwards. I mislabelled the tubes
# during regrowth.
