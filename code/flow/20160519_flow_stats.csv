# Comments about run
# date: 20160519
# dgoR related:
# After sorting (on previous day), cells were grown overnight in LB with
# Kan antibiotic. These cells were re-diluted and grown in M9 glucose
# (1:500 dilution) and remeasured to confirm that sorting happened.
# Looks good.
# purT and xylE related:
# The plan was to sort cells containing xylE and purT promoter libraries.
# Cells were grown in M9 glucose. Three different plasmid
# libraries were sorted for each (mut1, mut2, and mut3
# associated with each mutation windows). Only the purT
# library was sorted this time; expression of three xylE windows were identical
# to autofluorescence (MG1655 without any GFP promoter plasmid).
