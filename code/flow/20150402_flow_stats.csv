# Comments about run
# date: 20150402
# mar related:
# Looked at mar promoter libraries in MG1655 delta marR, as well as
# in MG1655 delta marRAB strains. Growth of cells was in LB media
# at 30C.
# rel related:
# After overnight growth of sorted cells (rel , where only the downstream
region after the RNAP binding site should be mutated).
# The library was PCR amplified such that the RNAP
# region should be mainly wild-type. These cells were grown in M9 glucose.
# Post analysis note: The upstream region where RNAP binds turned out to have
# some non-negligible mutation rate. This is likely due to the amount of initial
# library I input into the PCR during construction (since this library was based
# on the other full mut1 library). It still looks like the data is good.
