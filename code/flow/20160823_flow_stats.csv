# Comments about run:
# date: 20160823
# JK10 strain grown in EZrich media. Supplemented with:
# A) Glucose, 0 uM cAMP
# B) Xylose, 500 uM cAMP
# Note that growth was very slow (if at all) for the glucose, 0 uM cAMP cells.
# I didn't end up sorting the glucose ones since there were few cells and the expression
# was essentially autofluorescence.
